# vue-eprase

> The Vue version of the eprase client.

## Local Development Build Setup 

Pull down the copy of the repo, then cd into the directory and use npm to install the required dependencies

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```

### Build for production with minification

Running the build command creates a build folder called 'dist'. This contains all the images and a build.js file of minified code

```
npm run build
```
